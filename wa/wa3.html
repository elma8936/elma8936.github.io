<!--about texas-->
<h2 id="aboutTexas">About Texas</h2>
<p>Texas is a state in the South Central region of the United States. 
    At 268,596 square miles (695,660 km2), and with more than 30 million 
    residents in 2023, it is the second-largest U.S. state by both 
    area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders 
    with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma 
    to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, 
    Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and southwest; and has a
     coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.</p>
<!--Cities in texas-->
<h2 id="citiesInTexas"> Cities in Texas</h2>
<p> Houston is the most populous city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the U.S., 
    while San Antonio is the second most populous in the state and seventh-largest in 
    the country. Dallas-Fort Worth and Greater Houston are, respectively, the fourth- 
    and fifth-largest metropolitan statistical areas in the country. Other major cities
     include Austin, the second most populous state capital in the U.S., and El Paso. 
     Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State for its former status as an independent republic, 
     and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The Lone Star can be 
     found on the Texas state flag and the Texas state seal.[13] The origin of Texas's name is from 
     the Caddo word táysha meaning 'friends'.</p>

<!--Land-->
<h2 id="landscape">Landscape</h2>
<p>Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes common to both the U.S.
     Southern and the Southwestern regions.[14] Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less 
     than ten percent of Texas's land area is desert.[15] Most population centers are in areas of former prairies, grasslands, 
     forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, terrain ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling 
     plains and rugged hills, to the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.</p>

<!--A Brief History-->
<h2 id="aBriefHistory"> A Brief History</h2>
<p>Spanish missionaries were the first European settlers in Texas, founding San Antonio in 1718. 
    Hostile natives and isolation from other Spanish colonies kept Texas sparsely populated until 
    following the Revolutionary War and the War of Mexican Independence when the newly established Mexican government began to 
    allow settlers from the U.S. to claim land there. This led to a population explosion, but dramatically reduced the percentage 
    of the population with Mexican heritage, causing friction with the government in Mexico City. After several smaller insurrections, 
    the Texas Revolution broke out, and the state became an independent nation in 1836. However, the newly formed Texas Republic was 
    unable to defend itself from further incursions by Mexican troops and eventually negotiated with the U.S. to join the union in 1845.</p>
