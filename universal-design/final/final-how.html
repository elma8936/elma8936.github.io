                <h2>How to design for everyone</h2>
                <p>After understanding why accessibility is important and what it is, it is now time to learn how to implement what you learned. HTML (HyperText markup Language) is the standard language for the web. Accompanied by CSS (cascading style sheets), HTML can make beautiful and accessible websites. Learning how to code accessible from the start will set you up for success. The good news is that the newest version of HTML5 already comes with assistive technology that will help you integrate accessibility without any extra work. Where HTML5 falls short, there is technology called ARIA that helps make accessibility more accessible to coders. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) are a set of attributes that can be used in combination with HTML elements that tell the web how to make elements accessible. Specifically, ARIA can help enhance the use of screen readers and keyboard users. ARIA elements can help give descriptions and context around elements on the page, like images.</p>
                <p>The best way to ensure your website is accessible is to follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). These are guidelines that were made to set standards for accessibility in technology. They follow four main principles: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> has 13 guidelines that fall under the four principles and they each have testable success criteria.</p>
                <h2>Coding</h2>
                <p>If you are learning how to code, use websites like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax">MDN Web Docs</a> to learn how to add accessibility to certain elements. Start small and start simple. Once you have made your webpage be sure to test it against standards to ensure it is accessible.</p>
                <p>Important things to keep in mind are alternative texts for images, information architecture like headings, interactions and overall visual cues. A useful resource is this <a href="https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist/">checklist by WEB AIM</a> to ensure your website is ready for publication.</p>
                <p>It can also be helpful to keep in mind the 10 usability heuristics to access a website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visibility of system status</li>
                    <li>Match between system and real world</li>
                    <li>User control and freedom</li>
                    <li>Consistency and standards</li>
                    <li>Error prevention</li>
                    <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
                    <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
                    <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
                    <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
                    <li>Help and documentation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are also very powerful web accessibility tools that can check your website automatically and can be downloaded as a web extension. Web AIM’s wave evaluation tool that will point out issues like contrast issues and structural issues. It is recommended to use these resources as you use and update your webpage.</p>
