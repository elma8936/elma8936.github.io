                <h2>What is universal design?</h2>
                <p>Providing accessibility to the web ensures that certain aspects of a page follow rules and regulations. Integrating accessibility from the start will make designing more efficient and equitable. Consider these aspects before designing and building a web interface to make it accessible:</p>
                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>Selecting and placing typography is extremely important in an interface's legibility. To make text visible and stand out, it is important that text is large enough and has a high contrast with the background. Picking a simple typeface will also increase legibility. Oftentimes it is a good idea to pick a different typeface for headings to signify hierarchy in the page’s text. It is recommended to keep lines of text between 40 - 60 characters long. Text that stretches the entire width of the screen can tire users' eyes and ability to concentrate.</p>
                <h3>Color theme and color contrast</h3>
                <p>Color contrast is the difference in brightness between the background and the elements that sit on it. Low contrast can cause people with low vision or color blindness to not be able to fully access a website. It is recommended that text have a color contrast of at least 4.5:1. Before committing to a color scheme, make sure to check the color contrast of the background and all elements of the page. You can use helpful websites like <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer">Adobe’s Color Contrast checker</a>.</p>
                <h3>Information architecture</h3>
                <p> While designing your website, it is important you consider how your website will be laid out, and how a user will navigate through the webpage. Users should easily be able to infer the layout by simply reviewing the page. Layouts should be logical and intuitive. Keep navigation confident and clear. It is a good idea to start by understanding your audience and their goals on your website. Consider the steps they might go through to complete a task. Consider how these tasks would feel without any visual cues like using assistive technology like a screen reader.</p>
                <h3>Interactive design</h3>
                <p>The user's interaction with the page should be simple and clear. Users should not be concerned with the inner workings of the system and should not be overwhelmed with information. It is important that the webpage is adaptive and helps users get back on track when an error occurs.</p>
                <h3>Cognitive accessibility and reducing cognitive load</h3>
                <p>Sites should be designed to not be overwhelming or distracting. Reducing the cognitive load of interacting with a web page will make it easier for people to interpret the information on the page. Provide consistent layout and predictable patterns for users. It is better to have a visually simplistic website that is accessible to all than a website that is overly visual.</p>
