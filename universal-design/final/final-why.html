                <h2>Why universal design?</h2>
                <p>The web is an increasingly powerful and important tool for our society but it is unfairly inaccessible to many people. Much of the web has been designed without inclusive approaches in mind. This prevents users from having the same access to information and resources. According to the World Health Organization, 16% of the world's population experience significant disability.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="center"><strong>1 and 6 people experience significant disability</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>It is vital that we begin to include accessibility from the start and create an inclusive world on the web. It should be something that brings everyone together regardless of geography, language, culture, age, ability, and technology access.
                    As members of society it is our responsibility to educate ourselves and change our mindset on what disability is. To ensure that everyone has the same opportunities in life to learn, work, grow and explore, it is vital that we account for everybody and be prepared to incorporate them in every conversation. Disability is all around us, whether we notice it or not. Disabilities are a part of the human experience and can happen to anyone. Making everyone has the same access to the internet is no longer a luxury, it’s a requirement. 
                    With today’s technology and when considered from the start incorporating accessibility to the web is not as challenging of a task as some might think. This website will help you understand what web standards are and how you can become a more inclusive designer.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="center"><strong>Barriers create the disability, not the person</strong></p>
                <br>
                <h2>Types of disabilities</h2>
                <p>Disabilities are incredibly diverse and look different for everyone. Web design needs to be able to support the whole range of functional differences. Some disabilities are visible but many are non-visible to the outside world. Disabilities that are not immediately obvious can make it harder to get the support they need, building accessibility first, all the more important.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Get to know types of barriers people may face while accessing the internet:</p>
                <h3>Physical</h3>
                <p>Physical disability limits a person’s mobility, dexterity or stamina.</p>
                <h3>Age-related</h3>
                <p>Reduced mobility, dementia, Alzheimer’s, hearing/vision loss can impact how users understand and use of the internet.</p>
                <h3>Mental disorders</h3>
                <p>Anxiety, depression and other mental disorders can make it harder to spend time online and interact with technology.</p>
                <h3>Health conditions</h3>
                <p>Fatigue and pain from health conditions could impact their physical use of the computer or limit the duration of use.</p>
                <h3>Temporary impairment</h3>
                <p>An accident, surgery, or medication can impair a user unexpectedly. They may need to learn how to use accessibility features.</p>
                <h3>Situational limitations</h3>
                <p>Environmental situations may disable a person temporarily from using technology as they normally would. A loud environment may leave users unable to hear audio. Similarly, bright sunlight may cause users to have difficulty seeing a screen. Users may experience a cost barrier to afford some technologies.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>What we can do</h3>
                <p>The good news is that there is technology to make the web more accessible. It is our job as web professionals to use these tools to the best of our abilities and increase inclusivity. This website will help you get started understanding what web accessibility is and how you can integrate it into your work.</p>
