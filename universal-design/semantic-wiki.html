                <p> The bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), sometimes called the Greenland right whale,
                     Arctic whale, and polar whale, is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family 
                     Balaenidae and is the only living representative of the genus Balaena. It is 
                     the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters, and is named after 
                     its characteristic massive triangular skull, which it uses to break through Arctic 
                     ice. Bowheads have the largest mouth of any animal representing almost one-third 
                     of the length of the body, the longest baleen plates with a maximum length of 4 m (13 ft), 
                     and may be the longest-lived mammals, with the ability to reach an age of more than 200 
                     years. The bowhead was an early whaling target. Their population was severely reduced
                      before a 1966 moratorium was passed to protect the species. Of the five stocks of bowhead 
                      populations, three are listed as "endangered", one as "vulnerable", and one as "lower risk, 
                      conservation dependent" according to the IUCN Red List. The global population is assessed 
                      as of least concern.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p> Carl Linnaeus named this species in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae (1758).[5] 
                    It was seemingly identical to its relatives in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and 
                    Southern Oceans, and as such they were all thought to be a single species, collectively 
                    known as the "right whale", and given the binomial name Balaena mysticetus.</p>
                    
                <p>Today, the bowhead whale occupies a monotypic genus, separate from the right whales, as 
                    proposed by the work of John Edward Gray in 1821.[6] For the next 180 years, the family 
                    Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly 
                    recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, 
                    three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. Eventually, 
                    it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were different, but there was still 
                    no strong consensus as to whether they shared a single genus or two. As recently as 1998, 
                    Dale Rice listed just two species – B. glacialis (the right whales) and B. mysticetus 
                    (the bowheads) – in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification.[7]</p>

                <p>Studies in the 2000s finally provided clear evidence that the three living right whale 
                    species comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and that the bowhead 
                    and the right whales are rightly classified into two separate genera.[8] The right whales 
                    were thus confirmed to be in a separate genus, Eubalaena. </p>

                <p>The earlier fossil record shows no related cetacean after Morenocetus, found in a South 
                    American deposit dating back 23 million years.</p>

                <p>An unknown species of right whale, the so-called "Swedenborg whale", which was proposed 
                    by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century, was once thought to be a North Atlantic right 
                    whale. Based on later DNA analysis, those fossil bones claimed to be from Swedenborg whales 
                    were confirmed to be from bowhead whales.[10]</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The bowhead whale is among the largest baleen whale species and is distinguished by its round
                     body with an exceptionally curved rostrum, a large head, and long, dark baleen plates. Relative
                      to its size, the bowhead whale has the largest head of any cetacean,[11] measuring nearly 40% 
                      of the total body length.[12] Two blowholes are situated atop its head, and help propel a 
                      stream of water up to 6.1 m (20 ft) in the air.[13] The lower lips encompasses the baleen 
                      racks and resembles a curved circular shape when viewed from the side. It also has wide, 
                      trigonal flukes and fairly large, oar-shaped flippers. The skin is mostly black with white 
                      patches around the flukes, tail, eyes, and chin. These patches develop throughout life, with
                       the exception of the patch surrounding the chin, which is usually visible in newborn calves, 
                       and increases in size at the same rate with the whale's overall growth.</p>
                       
                <p>An adult whale usually measures 14 to 18 m (46 to 59 ft) in length and 75 to 100 t (74 to 98 
                    long tons; 83 to 110 short tons) in weight. The fluke of this species measures 2–6 m (6 ft 7 in – 19 ft 8 in) 
                    long and the 230 to 360 baleen plates are thought to grow to 4 m (13 ft) long, which is longer than that of 
                    any other whale by more than a meter. This species is sexually dimorphic as females usually reach lengths of 
                    16–18 m (52–59 ft), while males average 14–16 m (46–52 ft). There are, however, some specimens that exceed 
                    these sizes. In one instance, a female killed off the waters of Pond Inlet in the 1800s allegedly measured 
                    19.5 m (64 ft). Some estimates put the total maximum length higher at about 20 m (66 ft).[14][15] The maximum 
                    reliable length of the female is currently believed to be about 19 m (62 ft), while the maximum length of the 
                    male is thought to be 16–17 m (52–56 ft).</p>

                <p>Analysis of hundreds of DNA samples from living whales and from baleen used in vessels, toys, and housing material has shown that Arctic bowhead whales have lost a significant portion of their genetic diversity in the past 500 years. Bowheads originally crossed ice-covered inlets and straits to exchange genes between Atlantic and Pacific populations. This conclusion was derived from analyzing maternal lineage using mitochondrial DNA. Whaling and climatic cooling during the Little Ice Age, from the 16th century to the 19th, is supposed to have reduced the whales' summer habitats, which explains the loss of genetic diversity.</p>
