                <p> The bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), sometimes called the Greenland right whale,
                     Arctic whale, and polar whale, is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family 
                     Balaenidae and is the only living representative of the genus Balaena. It is 
                     the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters, and is named after 
                     its characteristic massive triangular skull, which it uses to break through Arctic 
                     ice. Bowheads have the largest mouth of any animal representing almost one-third 
                     of the length of the body, the longest baleen plates with a maximum length of 4 m (13 ft), 
                     and may be the longest-lived mammals, with the ability to reach an age of more than 200 
                     years. The bowhead was an early whaling target. Their population was severely reduced
                      before a 1966 moratorium was passed to protect the species. Of the five stocks of bowhead 
                      populations, three are listed as "endangered", one as "vulnerable", and one as "lower risk, 
                      conservation dependent" according to the IUCN Red List. The global population is assessed 
                      as of least concern.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p> Carl Linnaeus named this species in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae (1758).[5] 
                    It was seemingly identical to its relatives in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and 
                    Southern Oceans, and as such they were all thought to be a single species, collectively 
                    known as the "right whale", and given the binomial name Balaena mysticetus.</p>
                    
                <p>Today, the bowhead whale occupies a monotypic genus, separate from the right whales, as 
                    proposed by the work of John Edward Gray in 1821.[6] For the next 180 years, the family 
                    Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly 
                    recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, 
                    three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. Eventually, 
                    it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were different, but there was still 
                    no strong consensus as to whether they shared a single genus or two. As recently as 1998, 
                    Dale Rice listed just two species – B. glacialis (the right whales) and B. mysticetus 
                    (the bowheads) – in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification.[7]</p>

                <p>Studies in the 2000s finally provided clear evidence that the three living right whale 
                    species comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and that the bowhead 
                    and the right whales are rightly classified into two separate genera.[8] The right whales 
                    were thus confirmed to be in a separate genus, Eubalaena. </p>

                <p>The earlier fossil record shows no related cetacean after Morenocetus, found in a South 
                    American deposit dating back 23 million years.</p>

                <p>An unknown species of right whale, the so-called "Swedenborg whale", which was proposed 
                    by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century, was once thought to be a North Atlantic right 
                    whale. Based on later DNA analysis, those fossil bones claimed to be from Swedenborg whales 
                    were confirmed to be from bowhead whales.[10]</p>

                <p>The bowhead whale is among the largest baleen whale species and is distinguished by its round
                     body with an exceptionally curved rostrum, a large head, and long, dark baleen plates. Relative
                      to its size, the bowhead whale has the largest head of any cetacean,[11] measuring nearly 40% 
                      of the total body length.[12] Two blowholes are situated atop its head, and help propel a 
                      stream of water up to 6.1 m (20 ft) in the air.[13] The lower lips encompasses the baleen 
                      racks and resembles a curved circular shape when viewed from the side. It also has wide, 
                      trigonal flukes and fairly large, oar-shaped flippers. The skin is mostly black with white 
                      patches around the flukes, tail, eyes, and chin. These patches develop throughout life, with
                       the exception of the patch surrounding the chin, which is usually visible in newborn calves, 
                       and increases in size at the same rate with the whale's overall growth.</p>

                <p>An adult whale usually measures 14 to 18 m (46 to 59 ft) in length and 75 to 100 t (74 to 98 
                    long tons; 83 to 110 short tons) in weight. The fluke of this species measures 2–6 m (6 ft 7 in – 19 ft 8 in) 
                    long and the 230 to 360 baleen plates are thought to grow to 4 m (13 ft) long, which is longer than that of 
                    any other whale by more than a meter. This species is sexually dimorphic as females usually reach lengths of 
                    16–18 m (52–59 ft), while males average 14–16 m (46–52 ft). There are, however, some specimens that exceed 
                    these sizes. In one instance, a female killed off the waters of Pond Inlet in the 1800s allegedly measured 
                    19.5 m (64 ft). Some estimates put the total maximum length higher at about 20 m (66 ft).[14][15] The maximum 
                    reliable length of the female is currently believed to be about 19 m (62 ft), while the maximum length of the 
                    male is thought to be 16–17 m (52–56 ft).</p>

                <p>Analysis of hundreds of DNA samples from living whales and from baleen used in vessels, toys, and housing 
                    material has shown that Arctic bowhead whales have lost a significant portion of their genetic diversity 
                    in the past 500 years. Bowheads originally crossed ice-covered inlets and straits to exchange genes between 
                    Atlantic and Pacific populations. This conclusion was derived from analyzing maternal lineage using mitochondrial
                     DNA. Whaling and climatic cooling during the Little Ice Age, from the 16th century to the 19th, is supposed to 
                     have reduced the whales' summer habitats, which explains the loss of genetic diversity.</p>

                <p>A 2013 discovery has clarified the function of the bowhead's large palatal retial organ. The bulbous ridge of highly 
                    vascularized tissue, the corpus cavernosum maxillaris, extends along the centre of the hard plate, forming two 
                    large lobes at the rostral palate. The tissue is histologically similar to that of the corpus cavernosum of the
                    mammalian penis. This organ is thought to provide a mechanism of cooling for the whale (which is normally protected 
                    from the cold Arctic waters by 40 cm (16 in) or more of fat). During physical exertion, the whale must cool itself to 
                    prevent hyperthermia (and ultimately brain damage). This organ becomes engorged with blood, and as the whale opens its 
                    mouth cold seawater flows over the organ, thus cooling the blood.[18]</p>

                <p>In one study, the brain size of two males that measured 12 and 13.3 m (39 and 44 ft) in total length, were recorded at 
                    2.072 and 2.280 kg (4.57 and 5.03 lb), respectively. With a gyrencephalic index of 2.32, the brains of the two males 
                    were found to exhibit extreme gyrification. Compared to other cetaceans, their brain had a lower level of gyrification 
                    in the cerebral cortex, more vertically-aligned gyri, and a relatively dull temporal pole region.</p>

                <p>Beluga whales often accompany bowhead whales, for curiosity and to secure polynya feasibility to breathe as bowheads are 
                    capable of breaking through ice from underwater by headbutting.[20]</p>

                    <h3>Swimming</h3>
                    <p>The bowhead whale is not a social animal, typically travelling alone or in small pods of up to six. It is able to 
                        dive and remain submerged under water for up to an hour. The time spent under water in a single dive is usually 
                        limited to 9–18 minutes.[21] The bowhead is not thought to be a deep diver, but can reach a depth down to 150 m 
                        (500 ft). It is a slow swimmer, normally travelling around 2–5 km/h (0.56–1.39 m/s; 1.2–3.1 mph).[22] When fleeing 
                        from danger, it can travel at a speed of 10 km/h (2.8 m/s; 6.2 mph). During periods of feeding, the average swim 
                        speed is increased to 1.1–2.5 m/s (4.0–9.0 km/h; 2.5–5.6 mph).[23]</p>

                    <h3>Feeding</h3>
                    <p>The head of the bowhead whale comprises a large portion of its body length, creating an enormous feeding apparatus.
                        [23] The bowhead whale is a filter feeder, and feeds by swimming forward with its mouth wide open.[21] It has hundreds 
                        of overlapping baleen plates consisting of keratin hanging from each side of the upper jaw. The mouth has a large, upturning
                         lip on the lower jaw that helps to reinforce and hold the baleen plates within the mouth. This also prevents buckling or 
                         breakage of the plates from the pressure of the water passing through them as the whale advances. To feed, water is filtered 
                         through the fine hairs of keratin of the baleen plates, trapping the prey inside near the tongue where it is then swallowed.
                         [24] The diet consists of mostly zooplankton, which includes krill, copepods, mysids, amphipods, and many other crustaceans.
                         [23][25] About 1.8 t (2 short tons) of food are consumed each day.[24] While foraging, bowheads are solitary or occur in
                          groups of two to 10 or more.</p>

                    <p>Bowhead whales are highly vocal[27] and use low frequency (1000 Hz) sounds to communicate while travelling, feeding, and socialising.
                         Intense calls for communication and navigation are produced especially during migration season. During breeding season, bowheads make 
                         long, complex, variable songs for mating calls.[22] Many tens of distinct songs are sung by a population in a single season.[28] From 
                         2010 through to 2014, near Greenland, 184 distinct songs were recorded from a population of around 300 animals.[29] </p>

                <section id="Reproduction">
                    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
                    <p>Sexual activity occurs between pairs and in boisterous groups of several males and one or two females. Breeding season is observed from 
                        March through August; conception is believed to occur primarily in March when song activity is at its highest.[22] Sexual maturity is 
                        estimated to be reached at 25 years, and physical maturity at 50–60 years. The gestation period is 13–14 months with females producing 
                        a calf once every three to four years.[30][16] Lactation typically lasts about a year. Female bowheads may be capable of producing calves 
                        for 100 years. To survive in the cold water immediately after birth, calves are born with a thick layer of blubber. Within 30 minutes of birth, 
                        bowhead calves are able to swim on their own. A newborn calf is typically 4–4.5 m (13–15 ft) long, weighs roughly 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), and grows 
                        to 8.2 m (27 ft) within the first year.[30]</p>

                    <p>Bowhead whales are considered to be the longest-living mammals, living for over 200 years.[31] In May 2007, a 15 m (49 ft) specimen 
                        caught off the Alaskan coast was discovered with the 89 mm (3.5 in) head of an explosive bomb lance of a model manufactured between 
                        1879 and 1885 lodged in its body, so the whale was probably bomb lanced sometime between those years, and its age at the time of 
                        death was estimated at between 115 and 130 years.[32] Spurred by this discovery, scientists measured the ages of other bowhead 
                        whales captured between 1978 and 1996; one specimen was estimated to be 211 years old.[33][34] Other bowhead whales were estimated 
                        to be between 135 and 172 years old. This discovery showed the longevity of the bowhead whale is much greater than originally 
                        thought.[35] Researchers at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, estimated that bowhead whales' maximum natural 
                        lifespan is 268 years based on genetic analysis</p>

                    <p>A greater number of cells present in an organism was once believed to result in greater chances of mutations that cause age-related
                         diseases and cancer.[37] Although the bowhead whale has thousands of times more cells than other mammals, it has a much higher 
                         resistance to cancer and aging. In 2015, scientists from the US and UK were able to successfully map the whale's genome.[38] 
                         Through comparative analysis, two alleles that could be responsible for the whale's longevity were identified. These two 
                         specific gene mutations linked to the bowhead whale's ability to live longer are the ERCC1 gene and the proliferating cell 
                         nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene. ERCC1 is linked to DNA repair and increased cancer resistance. PCNA is also important in DNA 
                         repair. These mutations enable bowhead whales to better repair DNA damage, allowing for greater resistance to cancer.[37] 
                         The whale's genome may also reveal physiological adaptations such as having low metabolic rates compared to other mammals.
                         [39] Changes in the gene UCP1, a gene involved in thermoregulation, can explain differences in the metabolic
                         rates in cells.</p>

                    <h3>Range and habitat</h3>
                    <p>The bowhead whale is the only baleen whale to spend its entire life in the Arctic and subarctic waters.[40] The Alaskan 
                        population spends the winter months in the southwestern Bering Sea. The group migrates northward in the spring, 
                        following openings in the ice, into the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.[41] The whale's range varies depending on climate 
                        changes and on the forming/melting of ice.</p>

                    <p>Historically, bowhead whales' range may have been broader and more southerly than currently thought. Bowheads were 
                        abundant around Labrador, Newfoundland (Strait of Belle Isle) and the northern Gulf of St Lawrence until at least
                         the 16th and 17th centuries. It is unclear whether this was due to the colder climate during these periods.[43] 
                         The distribution of Balaena spp. during the Pleistocene were far more southerly as fossils have been excavated 
                         from Italy and North Carolina, thus could have overlapped between those of Eubalaena based on 
                         those locations.</p>

                    <h3>Population</h3>
                    <p>Generally, five stocks of bowhead whales are recognized: 1 the Western Arctic stock in the Bering, Chukchi, and 
                        Beaufort Seas, 2 the Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin stock, 3 the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait stock, 4) the Sea of 
                        Okhotsk stock, and 5 the Svalbard-Barents Sea stock. However, recent evidence suggests that the Hudson Bay and 
                        Foxe Basin stock and the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait stock should be considered one stock based on genetics and
                         movements of tagged whales</p>

                        <h4>Western Arctic</h4>
                        <p>The Western Arctic bowhead population, also known as the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population, has recovered 
                            since the commercial harvest of this stock ceased in the early 1900s. A 2019 study estimated that the Western
                             Arctic population was 12,505; although it was lower than the 2011 value of 16,820, the surveyors believed 
                             there was no significant decline in 2011–2019 due to the unusual conditions of whale migration and observation 
                             in 2019.[46] The yearly growth rate of the Western Arctic bowhead population was 3.7% from 1978 to 2011. 
                             These data suggest that the Western Arctic bowhead stock may be near its precommercial whaling level.[45] 
                             Migration patterns of this population are being affected by climate change.</p>

                        <p>Alaskan Natives continue to hunt small numbers of bowhead whales for subsistence purposes. The Alaska Eskimo
                             Whaling Commission co-manages the bowhead subsistence harvest with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
                             Administration. The Alaskan villages that participate in the bowhead subsistence harvest include Barrow, 
                             Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, Nuiqsut, Kaktovik, Gambell, Savoonga, Kivalina, Wales, and Little 
                             Diomede.[48] The annual subsistence harvest of the Western Arctic stock has ranged from 14 to 72, 
                             amounting to an estimated 0.1-0.5% of the population.[45]</p>

                        <p>In March 2008, Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans stated the previous estimates in the eastern
                             Arctic had undercounted, with a new estimate of 14,400 animals (range 4,800–43,000).[49] These larger 
                             numbers correspond to prewhaling estimates, indicating the population has fully recovered. However, 
                             if climate change substantially shrinks sea ice, these whales could be threatened by increased 
                             shipping traffic.[50]</p>
                        <p>The status of other populations is less well known. About 1,200 were off West Greenland in 2006, 
                            while the Svalbard population may only number in the tens. However, the numbers have been

                        <h4>Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin</h4>
                        <p>The Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin population is distinct from the Baffin Bay – Davis Strait group.[52] 
                            The original population size of this local group is unclear, but possibly about 500 to 600 whales annually
                             summered in the northwestern part of the bay in the 1860s.[53] It is likely that the number of whales that
                              actually inhabit Hudson Bay is much smaller than the total population size of this group,[54] but reports 
                              from local indigenous people indicate that this population is increasing over decades.[55] Larger portions 
                              of the bay are used for summering, while wintering is on a smaller scale. Some animals winter in Hudson Strait, 
                              most notably north of Igloolik Island and north eastern Hudson Bay. Distribution patterns in these regions are 
                              affected by the presence of orca, and bowheads can disappear from normal ranges in the presence of atypical 
                              numbers of orca. Increased mortality caused by orca attack is a possible outcome of climate change, as 
                              reduced ice coverage is expected to result in fewer areas that the bowheads can use for shelter from 
                              attack.[55] Whaling grounds in the 19th century stretched from Marble Island to Roes Welcome Sound
                              and to Lyon Inlet and Fisher Strait, and whales still migrate through most of these areas.</p>

                        <p>Distribution within Hudson Bay is mostly restricted to the northwestern part[52] along with Wager 
                            Bay,[56] Repulse Bay,[57] Southampton Island (one of two main known summering areas),[57][58] 
                            Frozen Strait, northern Foxe Basin, and north of Igloolik in summer.[55] Satellite tracking[59] 
                            indicates that some portions of the group within the bay do not venture further south than Whale 
                            Cove[57] and areas south of Coats and Mansel Islands.[citation needed] Cow – calf pairs and 
                            juveniles up to 13.5 m (44 ft) in length make up the majority of summering aggregation in the 
                            northern Foxe Basin, while matured males and noncalving females may use the northwestern part 
                            of Hudson Bay.[55] Fewer whales also migrate to the west coast of Hudson Bay and Mansel and 
                            Ottawa Islands.[55] Bowhead ranges within Hudson Bay are usually considered not to cover 
                            southern parts,[54][60] but at least some whales migrate to locations further south such 
                            s Sanikiluaq[citation needed] and Churchill river mouth.[61][62][63][64]</p>

                        <p>Congregation within Foxe Basin occurs in a well-defined area of 3,700 km2 (1,100 sq nmi) 
                            north of Igloolik Island to Fury and Hecla Strait and Kapuiviit and Gifford Fiord, and into 
                            Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet. Northward migrating along western Foxe Basin to 
                            eastern side of the basin also occurs in spring.[55]</p>

                        <p>Not much is known about the endangered Sea of Okhotsk population. To learn more about the 
                            population, these mammals have been regularly observed near the Shantar Islands, very
                             close to the shore, such as at Ongachan Bay.[66][67] Several companies provide whale-watching 
                             services, which are mostly land-based. According to Russian scientists, this total population 
                             likely does not exceed 400 animals.[65] Scientific research on this population was seldom done
                             before 2009, when researchers studying belugas noticed concentrations of bowheads in the study 
                             area. Thus, bowheads in the Sea of Okhotsk were once called "forgotten whales" by researchers. 
                             The WWF welcomed the creation of a nature sanctuary in the region[68]</p>

                            or the Korean Peninsula (although this record might be of a right whale[69]). The first documented 
                            report of the species in Japanese waters was of a strayed infant (7 m (23 ft)) caught in Osaka Bay
                             on 23 June 1969,[70] and the first live sighting was of a 10 m (33 ft) juvenile around Shiretoko 
                             Peninsula (the southernmost of ice floe range in the Northern Hemisphere) on 21 to 23 June 2015.[71] 
                             Fossils have been excavated on Hokkaido,[72] but it is unclear whether the northern coasts of Japan 
                             were once included in seasonal or occasional migration ranges.</p>

                        <p>Genetic studies suggest Okhotsk population share common ancestry with whales in Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort
                             Seas, and repeated mixings had occurred between whales in the two seas.[73]</p>

                        <p>The most endangered but historically largest of all bowhead populations is the Svalbard/Spitsbergen 
                            population.[74] Occurring normally in Fram Strait,[75] Barents Sea and Severnaya Zemlya along Kara 
                            Sea[51] to Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea regions, these whales were seen in entire coastal regions 
                            in European and Russian Arctic, even reaching to Icelandic and Scandinavian coasts and Jan Mayen in 
                            Greenland Sea, and west of Cape Farewell and western Greenland coasts.[76] Also, bowheads in this 
                            stock were possibly once abundant in areas adjacent to the White Sea region, where few or no 
                            animals currently migrate, such as the Kola and Kanin Peninsula. Today, the number of sightings 
                            elsewhere is very small,[77] but with increasing regularities[78] with whales having strong 
                            regional connections.[79] Whales have also started approaching townships and inhabited areas 
                            such as around Longyearbyen.[80] The waters around the marine mammal sanctuary[81] of Franz 
                            Josef Land is possibly functioning as the most important habitat for this population.[82][83]</p>

                        <p>It is unclear whether this population is a remnant of the historic Svalbard group, recolonized 
                            individuals from other stocks, or if a mixing of these two or more stocks has taken place. In 
                            2015, discoveries of the refuge along eastern Greenland where whaling ships could not reach 
                            due to ice floes[84] and largest numbers of whales (80–100 individuals) ever sighted between 
                            Spitsbergen and Greenland[85] indicate that more whales than previously considered survived 
                            whaling periods, and flows from the other populations are possible.</p>

                    <p>In 1978 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) introduced a hunting strike quota for the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea (BCB) bowhead.[88] The quota has remained at 67 strikes per year since 1998 and represents about 0.5 percent of BCB population.[88] The population of bowheads in West Greenland and Canada is estimated to be 6,000 and rising, and hunts in this are minimal (0.001 percent).[88] Both stocks are rising, and the indigenous hunts seem to be self-sustaining.[88] Orca are also known predators.[89] There is no consensus on the number of deaths by orca.[88] Bowheads seek the ice and shallow waters safety when threatened by orca.[22] Inuit have a traditional word for this behavior to give historical context that this is not a new phenomenon.[88] Global warming is increasing the frequency that orca are observed in the far north. A once-rare event, orca are now seen more frequently.[88]</p>

                <p>The bowhead whale has been hunted for blubber, meat, oil, bones, and baleen. Like the right whale, it swims slowly, and floats after death, making it ideal for whaling.[90] Before commercial whaling, they were estimated to number 50,000.[91] Paleo-Eskimo sites indicate bowhead whales were eaten in sites from perhaps 4000 BC. Inuit near the Pacific developed specific hunting tools, with the whales providing food and fuel.[92]</p>
                <p>Commercial bowhead whaling began in the 16th century when the Basques killed them as they migrated south through the Strait of Belle Isle in the fall and early winter. In 1611, the first whaling expedition sailed to Spitsbergen. The whaling settlement Smeerenburg was founded on Spitsbergen in 1619. By midcentury, the population(s) there had practically been wiped out, forcing whalers to voyage into the "West Ice"—the pack ice off Greenland's east coast. By 1719, they had reached the Davis Strait, and by the first quarter of the 19th century, Baffin Bay.[93]</p>

By 1849, 50 ships were hunting bowheads in each area; in the Bering Strait, 500 whales were killed that year, and that number jumped to more than 2000 in 1850.[95] By 1852, 220 ships were cruising around the Bering Strait region, which killed over 2,600 whales. Between 1854 and 1857, the fleet shifted to the Sea of Okhotsk, where 100–160 ships cruised annually. During 1858–1860, the ships shifted back to the Bering Strait region, where the majority of the fleet cruised during the summer until the early 20th century.[96] An estimated 18,600 bowheads were killed in the Bering Strait region between 1848 and 1914, with 60% of the total being reached within the first two decades. An estimated 18,000 bowheads were killed in the Sea of Okhotsk during 1847–1867, 80% in the first decade.[97]</p>
                <p>Bowheads were first taken along the pack ice in the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk, then in Tausk Bay and Northeast Gulf (Shelikhov Gulf). Soon, ships expanded to the west, catching them around Iony Island and then around the Shantar Islands. In the Western Arctic, they mainly caught them in the Anadyr Gulf, the Bering Strait, and around St. Lawrence Island. They later spread to the western Beaufort Sea (1854) and the Mackenzie River delta (1889).[96]</p>
                <p>Commercial whaling, the principal cause of the population decline, is over. Bowhead whales are now hunted on a subsistence level by native peoples of North America.[98]</p>

                <p>In 2024, the Inuit hunters of Aklavik, Northwest Territories were permitted to hunt and kill one bowhead whale to distribute the whale meat, an important part of Inuit cuisine, to Inuvialuit and Gwich'in communities in the region.[99]</p>

                <p>The bowhead is listed in Appendix I by CITES. While the global population is thought to be secure, thus assigned "least concern" status,[3] some populations are listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service as "endangered" under the auspices of the United States' Endangered Species Act. The IUCN Red List data are:[90]</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Svalbard population – critically endangered</li>
                    <li>Sea of Okhotsk subpopulation – endangered</li>
                    <li>Baffin Bay-Davis Strait stock – endangered</li>
                    <li>Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin stock – vulnerable (estimated to be 1,026 individuals in 2005 by DFO)[100]</li>
                    <li>Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock – lower risk – conservation dependent</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the USA government list the bowhead whale as federally endangered.[101]</p>
                <p>The bowhead whale is listed in Appendix I[102] of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range. CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration, and controlling other factors that might endanger them.[90]</p>
