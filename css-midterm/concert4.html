    <h3>Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé <br>
        JAN13-15 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00     
    </h3>
    
    <p> Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, which 
        he called a “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense of powerful, dramatic music which 
        defies category and springs to life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score creates a sensuous atmosphere 
        with a lingering explosiveness residing just underneath the surface. Scored for a massive orchestra and utilizing 
        the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often spotlights solo players in a way that recalls 
        chamber music rather than merely using it as a show of force, pulling listeners into a vast, visceral dreamscape 
        of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion. Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of Concertmaster 
        Yumi Hwang-Williams, who brings expressive virtuosity to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The 
        program opens with Lili Boulanger’s D’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a spring morning,’ capturing the genius of 
        this prodigious composer who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age of just 24. This sweet 
        and playful ode to spring is just the transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.<br>
