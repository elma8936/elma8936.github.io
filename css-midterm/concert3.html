    <h3>Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern <br>
        DEC 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00        
     </h3>

    <p> Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among the greats of 
    the keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with towering grandeur, gorgeously 
    lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat 
    has become the standard against which all virtuosos must measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and 
    a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this 
    cornerstone of the Classical Canon. Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” 
    by the San Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth Symphony. Written 
    to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and complex orchestrations that mirror his 
    own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless.<br>
